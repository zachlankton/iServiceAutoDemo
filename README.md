# This is a Demo App Created for iService Auto

The code that was worked on the most exists in the following folders (The rest being mostly boilerplate)

- [/api/src/Entity](https://github.com/zachlankton/iServiceAutoDemo/tree/main/api/src/Entity) - The Models
- [/pwa/pages](https://github.com/zachlankton/iServiceAutoDemo/tree/main/pwa/pages) - Web Page Entry Point
- [/pwa/components](https://github.com/zachlankton/iServiceAutoDemo/tree/main/pwa/components) - The Views / Layouts

In this project all controller code was automatically generated from the Models and Config by the API Platform
